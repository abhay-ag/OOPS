/*
    Pointers
    ________
    Every variable has an address in the memory which it is stored.
    POINTER Variables ==> the variables that store the address of another variable in the memory

        Eg: int a ==> 'a' stores 4 bytes in the memory and it has a name
            1000 -> 1004 memory block for a
            make a variable ptr to store the address of 'a' ==> Pointer Variable [Carrying the address of a]
